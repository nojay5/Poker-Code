# Poker-Code
I developed a custom web application using Node.js and EJS to track and analyze my poker stats as part of my weekly poker hobby. The application allows me to log session data, including date, buy-in amount, cash-out, and hours played, and then calculates specific statistics based on this data.

Unlike similar apps that charge over $10 monthly for comparable features, my application is fully customizable and tailored to my specific needs, giving me complete control over the data insights and functionality.
